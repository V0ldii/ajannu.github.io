      <description>Hi thereðŸ‘‹
I am Annu Jangra, but you can just call me Annu (cute name, right? hehe). Anyway, I am currently busy completing my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s in computer science.
The best way to describe myself would be an all-rounder (haha, joking), but seriously, I am someone you could refer to as a &amp;ldquo;jack of all trades, master of none.&amp;rdquo;
That might give you an idea that I have lots and lots of interests, right?</description>

      <description>Creating a Solana-Based Asset-Backed Cryptocurrency In todayâ€™s rapidly evolving financial landscape, blockchain technology is transforming how we perceive digital ownership, security, and asset management. My recent project explores these possibilities by creating a unique cryptocurrency token on the Solana blockchainâ€”an asset-backed digital currency designed to bridge traditional value with innovative blockchain technology.
Project Highlights: This project began with the creation and deployment of a custom Solana token. Using Solanaâ€™s robust programming model and consensus mechanisms, I developed a scalable cryptocurrency designed for speed, security, and efficiency.</description>

      <description>In this project, I set up a local AI server environment to support efficient AI model deployment and management on a personal machine. Leveraging Ollama for seamless model downloading and OpenUI for intuitive interaction, I created a streamlined platform for working with large language models, like Llama 3, directly on my device. This setup combines the flexibility of Docker for containerized management and Python version control with pyenv, ensuring compatibility across various dependencies.</description>
